IMPORTANT NOTES:

    * Some of the same risk factors influence both onset cyberbullying and cybervictimization.
    * Most studies find that age and gender don't play significant roles.
    * While it is expected that dark triad traits play a factor in cyberbullying, two studies say that it did not play a predictive role; in fact, the oppposite could be true. 
    * While aarly studies showed that perpetrators and victims typically experience bullying themselves, later research suggests that they can be popular, well-adjusted kids with no prior exposure. This makes cyberbullying and cybervictimization difficult to predict.
    * It can happen to anyone.
