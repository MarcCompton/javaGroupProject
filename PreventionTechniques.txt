What you can do to prevent or help when you notice signs of cyberbullying.
    1.  Teach more about cyberbullying and the effects of it.
        a.  If we make cyberbullying a part of the curriculum, it can help students understand the damage they could be doing to their classmates.
        b.  Raise awareness

    2.  Don't share personal information
        a.  No one should have any of your private emails and passwords unless it's your parents. Limit the amount of personal info you share on your social media, whether it's your phone number, address, or even your school.
        b.  Do not use anything obvious as your password. Make sure your password is unique, and use two-factor verification apps to secure your accounts.
        c.  Log out of accounts when not using.

    3.  Report if you see or know someone that is in the process of cyberbullying.
        a.  Make your parents, teachers, or whoever is aware. Many schools have zero tolerance for bullying in general and should do something about it.

        a.  Take as many screenshots as possible, whether of threatening messages, pictures, or videos. Anything can help the police when it's needed.
        b.  Avoid engaging

    5.  Limit access to technology or social media
        a.  I know it's hard, and you're tempted to see what else has been said about you, but looking will only make it worse.
